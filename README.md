Spring boot project with SOLID principles and design patterns in java.

What you will find here:
- SOLID principles examples with a bad code example and then, the solution with each of the principles
- Design Patters, including Behavioural, Creational and Structural examples.

## Behavioural Design Patterns
Behavioural patterns focus on how **objects communicate** and interact, managing the flow of information between entities.
Promotes loose coupling and flexibility

#### Common Applications
- Coordinating interactions between Objects
- Managing state transitions and communication efficiently

#### Examples:

- Strategy Pattern
- Command Pattern
- Template Method Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- State Pattern
- Mediator Pattern

## Creational Design Patterns
